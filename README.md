##Overview
The dclink-cap-extension is a standalone single-component PCB located twice inside the inverter box. It is connected in parallel with the Bamocar. The dclink-cap-extension consists in one capacitor taken from the first inverter of Chimera. 
It's used in order to solve the problem of the big amount of power dissipated by a fast acceleration of the motors: 
it is connected in parallel with the Bamocar (pins), so the capacitor can slow down the amount of current required by the motors, in this way there will be a little slower acceleration but less power dissipated.
